# 🔍 AI Web Research Agent (OpenAI + LangChain)

This is a Streamlit-based AI research assistant that uses LangChain, OpenAI, and multiple custom tools to help automate web research. Just input a question — the agent will analyze it, search the web, extract relevant information, summarize it, and provide key insights and keywords.
